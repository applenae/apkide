    <h3 id="SEC1">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
    <p>
        Version 2.1, February 1999
    </p>

    <pre>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
</pre>


    <h4 id="SEC2">Preamble</h4>

    <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
        freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
        Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
        free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    </p>
    <p>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
        Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
        can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
        this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
        strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
        not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
        for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
        it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
        it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
        these things.
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
        you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
        you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
        code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
        complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
        with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
        it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
        library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
        there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
        modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
        that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
        author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
        introduced by others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
        any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
        effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
        restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
        any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
        ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
        is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
        this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
        libraries into non-free programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
        a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
        combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
        General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
        entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
        the library.
    </p>
    <p>
        We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
        does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
        Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
        of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
        libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
        special circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
        a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
        allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
        library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
        case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
        software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
        programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
        free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
        non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
        operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
        system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
        users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
        linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
        that program using a modified version of the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
        "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
        be combined with the library in order to run.
    </p>

    <h4 id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h4>


    <p>
        <strong>0.</strong>
        This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
        program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
        other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
        this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
        Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    </p>
    <p>
        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
        which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
        Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
        straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
        included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    </p>
    <p>
        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
        making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
        and installation of the library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
        writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
        and what the program that uses the Library does.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong _mstmutation="1">1.</strong>
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
        complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
        you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
        appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
        all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
        warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
        Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
        and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
        fee.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong _mstmutation="1">2.</strong>
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
        above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a)</strong>
            The modified work must itself be a software library.
        </li>
        <li><strong>b)</strong>
            You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
        </li>

        <li><strong>c)</strong>
            You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
        </li>

        <li><strong>d)</strong>
            If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
            table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
            the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
            is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
            in the event an application does not supply such function or
            table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
            its purpose remains meaningful.
            <p>
                (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
                a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
                application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
                application-supplied function or table used by this function must
                be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
                root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
        sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
        reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
        this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
        distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
        sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
        distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
        permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
        each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
        rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
        the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
        based on the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
        the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
        or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
        this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3.</strong>
        You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
        License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
        this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
        that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
        instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
        ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
        that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
        these notices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
        that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    </p>
    <p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
        the Library into a program that is not a library.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4.</strong>
        You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
        derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
        under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
        it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
        must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
        medium customarily used for software interchange.
    </p>
    <p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
        source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
        distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
        compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>5.</strong>
        A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
        Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
        linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
        work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
        therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
        library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
        Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
        structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
        functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
        file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
        work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
        Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>6.</strong>
        As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
        link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
        work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
        under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
        this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
        directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
        of these things:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
            corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
            including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
            distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
            executable linked with the Library, with the complete
            machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
            and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
            then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
            modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the
            contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
            be able to recompile the application to use the modified
            definitions.)
        </li>

        <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
            for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
            (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
            user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
            the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
            version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
            modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
            work was made with.
        </li>

        <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
            valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
            materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
            than the cost of performing this distribution.
        </li>

        <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
            offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
            access to copy the above specified materials from the same
            place.
        </li>

        <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
            a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
            a copy.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
        Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
        reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
        the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
        the executable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
        accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
        distribute.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities
        that are a work
        based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
        other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
        the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
            of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
            library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of
            the Sections above.
        </li>

        <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
            library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
            Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
            form of the same work.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify,
        sublicense, link with,
        or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
        with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
        received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
        their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
        compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>9.</strong>
        You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
        signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
        distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
        modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
        all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
        the Library or works based on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>10.</strong>
        Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
        Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
        subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
        restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
        You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
        this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>11.</strong>
        If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
        distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
        may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
        license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
        all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
        the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
        particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
        and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
        impose that choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>12.</strong>
        If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
        original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
        an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
        so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
        excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
        written in the body of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>13.</strong>
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
        "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
        the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
        the Free Software Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>14.</strong>
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
        write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
        Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
        decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
        of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
        and reuse of software generally.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>15.</strong>
        BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
        WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
        EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
        LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
        THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>16.</strong>
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
        AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
        FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
        LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
        RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
        FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
        SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.

    a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>

<p> 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
    Object form.</p>

<p> 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
    sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
    patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
    Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution
    incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
    patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
    such litigation is filed.</p>

<p> 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
    that You meet the following conditions:</p>

<p> (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License;
    and</p>

<p> (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
    files; and</p>

<p> (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
    copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>

<p> (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
    contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
    distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
    provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
    Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file
    are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own
    attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
    the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
    construed as modifying the License.</p>

<p> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
    different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>

<p> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
    terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
    license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

<p> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
    service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary
    use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

<p> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
    provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot;
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
    permissions under this License.</p>

<p> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
    grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
    damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
    (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
    malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
    been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
    thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
    indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
    in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
    against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
    liability.</p>

<p>PREAMBLE<br>
    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
    efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
    open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
    with others.</p>

<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br>

    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
    however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
    to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>

<hr>
<p>Terms and Conditions</p>

<p>This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement</p>

<p>1. Introduction</p>

<p>1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the &quot;SDK&quot;
    and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
    licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a
    legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.</p>

<p>1.2 &quot;Android&quot; means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
    Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/,
    as updated from time to time.</p>

<p>1.3 A &quot;compatible implementation&quot; means any Android device that (i) complies with the
    Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
    website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to time;
    and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).</p>

<p>1.4 &quot;Google&quot; means Google Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business
    at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.</p>

<p>
    2. Accepting the License Agreement</p>

<p>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
    SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.</p>

<p>2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.</p>

<p>2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred
    from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the
    country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.</p>

<p>2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other
    entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or
    such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
    accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.</p>

<p>
    3. SDK License from Google</p>

<p>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
    royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely
    to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.</p>

<p>3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
    non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to
    develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of Android,
    provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.</p>

<p>3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
    SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. &quot;Intellectual
    Property Rights&quot; means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret
    law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
    expressly granted to you.</p>

<p>3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement.
    Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for
    backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or
    create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.</p>

<p>3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open source
    software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not
    the License Agreement.</p>

<p>3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior
    notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications
    developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or
    temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at
    Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.</p>

<p>3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.</p>

<p>3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
    (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
    SDK.</p>

<p>
    4. Use of the SDK by You</p>

<p>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under
    the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK,
    including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.</p>

<p>4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a)
    the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or
    guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or
    software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).</p>

<p>4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will
    protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names,
    passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware
    that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally
    adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or
    sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your
    application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to
    access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
    given you permission to do so.</p>

<p>4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or
    distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an
    unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party
    including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.</p>

<p>4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you
    or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display
    through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
    (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.</p>

<p>4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you
    or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any
    applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and
    for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer)
    of any such breach.</p>

<p>5. Your Developer Credentials</p>

<p>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
    credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
    will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
    credentials.</p>

<p>6. Privacy and Information</p>

<p>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
    statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
    address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
    SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
    SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
    collected.</p>

<p>6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
    accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>
    7. Third Party Applications</p>

<p>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
    content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
    those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
    resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility
    of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage
    that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party
    applications, data, content, or resources.</p>

<p>7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third
    party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
    providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
    loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources
    (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the
    relevant owners.</p>

<p>7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources
    may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the
    License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.</p>

<p>
    8. Using Android APIs</p>

<p>8.1 Google Data APIs</p>

<p>8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
    protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
    provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API
    may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
    distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
    allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.</p>

<p>8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that
    you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited
    purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the Android
    Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
    https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
    to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
    Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
    https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
    clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products
    where Google is a Data Processor.</p>

<p>
    9. Terminating the License Agreement</p>

<p>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as set
    out below.</p>

<p>9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the SDK
    and any relevant developer credentials.</p>

<p>9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached
    any provision of the License Agreement; or (B) Google is required to do so by law; or (C) the
    partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has terminated its
    relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google
    decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the country in
    which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the SDK or certain
    SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer commercially
    viable.</p>

<p>9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
    liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over
    time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
    indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
    continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.</p>

<p>
    10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</p>

<p>10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
    THE SDK IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
    FROM GOOGLE.</p>

<p>10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE
    SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR
    COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.</p>

<p>10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<p>
    11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>

<p>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
    LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING
    ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD
    HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.</p>

<p>
    12. Indemnification</p>

<p>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
    Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
    against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
    liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or
    accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that infringes
    any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right
    of any person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c)
    any non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.</p>

<p>

<p>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the SDK.
    When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
    on the website where the SDK is made available.</p>

<p>
    14. General Legal Terms</p>

<p>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
    governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
    separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google
    in relation to the SDK.</p>

<p>14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
    contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
    law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
    remedies will still be available to Google.</p>

<p>14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
    provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
    License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions
    of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>

<p>14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the
    parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies
    shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement
    that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or
    company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.</p>

<p>14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU
    MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE
    SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.</p>

<p>14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you
    or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be
    permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License Agreement without
    the prior written approval of the other party.</p>

<p>14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall
    be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws
    provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located
    within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the
    License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply
    for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>

<p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>Version 2.1, February 1999</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,
    Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br/>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>of
    this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br/>as the successor of the
    GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br/>the version number 2.1.]</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br/>freedom to share and change it.
    By contrast, the GNU General Public<br/>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
    and change<br/>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
<p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br/>specially designated
    software packages--typically libraries--of the<br/>Free Software Foundation and other authors
    who decide to use it. You<br/>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about
    whether<br/>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br/>strategy to
    use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br/>not price. Our General
    Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br/>you have the freedom to distribute copies of
    free software (and charge<br/>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can
    get<br/>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br/>it in new free
    programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br/>these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>distributors to deny you
    these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br/>rights. These restrictions translate to
    certain responsibilities for<br/>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify
    it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br/>or for a fee, you must
    give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br/>you. You must make sure that they, too,
    receive or can get the source<br/>code. If you link other code with the library, you must
    provide<br/>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br/>with the
    library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br/>it. And you must show them these
    terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br/>library, and (2) we offer
    you this license, which gives you legal<br/>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
    library.</p>
<p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br/>there is no warranty for the
    free library. Also, if the library is<br/>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients
    should know<br/>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br/>author's
    reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br/>introduced by others.</p>
<p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br/>any free program. We
    wish to make sure that a company cannot<br/>effectively restrict the users of a free program by
    obtaining a<br/>restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that<br/>any
    patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br/>consistent with the full
    freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br/>ordinary GNU General Public
    License. This license, the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, applies to certain designated
    libraries, and<br/>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use<br/>this
    license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br/>libraries into non-free
    programs.</p>
<p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br/>a shared library, the
    combination of the two is legally speaking a<br/>combined work, a derivative of the original
    library. The ordinary<br/>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br/>entire
    combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General<br/>Public License permits more lax
    criteria for linking other code with<br/>the library.</p>
<p>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br/>does Less to protect the
    user's freedom than the ordinary General<br/>Public License. It also provides other free
    software developers Less<br/>of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These
    disadvantages<br/>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br/>libraries.
    However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br/>special circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br/>encourage the widest possible
    use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br/>a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
    programs must be<br/>allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free<br/>library
    does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this<br/>case, there is little to gain
    by limiting the free library to free<br/>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public
    License.</p>
<p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br/>programs enables a greater
    number of people to use a large body of<br/>free software. For example, permission to use the
    GNU C Library in<br/>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br/>operating
    system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br/>system.</p>
<p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br/>users' freedom, it does
    ensure that the user of a program that is<br/>linked with the Library has the freedom and the
    wherewithal to run<br/>that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>modification follow. Pay close
    attention to the difference between a<br/>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
    library". The<br/>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br/>be
    combined with the library in order to run.</p>
<p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
    MODIFICATION</p>
<p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br/>program which contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder or<br/>other authorized party saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of<br/>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br/>Each
    licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br/>prepared so as to be
    conveniently linked with application programs<br/>(which use some of those functions and data)
    to form executables.</p>
<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br/>which has been distributed
    under these terms. A "work based on the<br/>Library" means either the Library or any derivative
    work under<br/>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br/>portion of
    it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br/>straightforwardly into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br/>included without limitation in the term
    "modification".)</p>
<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>making modifications to it.
    For a library, complete source code means<br/>all the source code for all modules it contains,
    plus any associated<br/>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br/>and
    installation of the library.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>covered by this License;
    they are outside its scope. The act of<br/>running a program using the Library is not
    restricted, and output from<br/>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
    based<br/>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br/>writing it).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br/>and what the program that uses the
    Library does.</p>
<p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br/>complete source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that<br/>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
    copy an<br/>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br/>all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br/>warranty; and distribute a copy
    of this License along with the<br/>Library.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br/>and you may at your option
    offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br/>fee.</p>
<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br/>of it, thus forming a
    work based on the Library, and copy and<br/>distribute such modifications or work under the
    terms of Section 1<br/>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>
<p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that you changed the
    files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br/>charge to all third parties
    under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br/>table of data to be
    supplied by an application program that uses<br/>the facility, other than as an argument passed
    when the facility<br/>is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br/>in
    the event an application does not supply such function or<br/>table, the facility still
    operates, and performs whatever part of<br/>its purpose remains meaningful.</p>
<p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br/>a purpose that is entirely
    well-defined independent of the<br/>application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br/>application-supplied
    function or table used by this function must<br/>be optional: if the application does not supply
    it, the square<br/>root function must still compute square roots.)</p>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br/>identifiable sections of that
    work are not derived from the Library,<br/>and can be reasonably considered independent and
    separate works in<br/>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>sections
    when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br/>distribute the same sections as
    part of a whole which is a work based<br/>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
    on the terms of<br/>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>entire
    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br/>it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>your rights to work
    written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>exercise the right to control the
    distribution of derivative or<br/>collective works based on the Library.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br/>with the Library (or
    with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br/>a storage or distribution medium does not
    bring the other work under<br/>the scope of this License.</p>
<p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br/>License instead of this
    License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br/>this, you must alter all the notices that
    refer to this License, so<br/>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
    version 2,<br/>instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br/>ordinary
    GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br/>that version instead if you
    wish.) Do not make any other change in<br/>these notices.</p>
<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br/>that copy, so the ordinary
    GNU General Public License applies to all<br/>subsequent copies and derivative works made from
    that copy.</p>
<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br/>the Library into a program
    that is not a library.</p>
<p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br/>derivative of it, under Section
    2) in object code or executable form<br/>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that
    you accompany<br/>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br/>must
    be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br/>medium customarily used for
    software interchange.</p>
<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br/>from a designated place,
    then offering equivalent access to copy the<br/>source code from the same place satisfies the
    requirement to<br/>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>compelled
    to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br/>Library, but is designed to
    work with the Library by being compiled or<br/>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
    Library". Such a<br/>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br/>therefore
    falls outside the scope of this License.</p>
<p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br/>creates an executable that
    is a derivative of the Library (because it<br/>contains portions of the Library), rather than a
    "work that uses the<br/>library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br/>Section
    6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>
<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br/>that is part of the
    Library, the object code for the work may be a<br/>derivative work of the Library even though
    the source code is not.<br/>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can
    be<br/>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br/>threshold for
    this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>
<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br/>structure layouts and accessors,
    and small macros and small inline<br/>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of
    the object<br/>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br/>work.
    (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br/>Library will still fall under
    Section 6.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br/>distribute the object code for
    the work under the terms of Section 6.<br/>Any executables containing that work also fall under
    Section 6,<br/>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
<p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br/>link a "work that uses the
    Library" with the Library to produce a<br/>work containing portions of the Library, and
    distribute that work<br/>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br/>modification
    of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br/>engineering for debugging such
    modifications.</p>
<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br/>Library is used in it and
    that the Library and its use are covered by<br/>this License. You must supply a copy of this
    License. If the work<br/>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br/>copyright
    notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br/>directing the user to the copy of
    this License. Also, you must do one<br/>of these things:</p>
<p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br/>machine-readable source code for the
    Library including whatever<br/>changes were used in the work (which must be distributed
    under<br/>Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br/>with the
    Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br/>uses the Library", as object code
    and/or source code, so that the<br/>user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
    modified<br/>executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br/>that the user who
    changes the contents of definitions files in the<br/>Library will not necessarily be able to
    recompile the application<br/>to use the modified definitions.)</p>
<p>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br/>Library. A suitable mechanism
    is one that (1) uses at run time a<br/>copy of the library already present on the user's
    computer system,<br/>rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br/>will
    operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br/>the user installs one, as long
    as the modified version is<br/>interface-compatible with the version that the work was made
    with.</p>
<p>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br/>least three years, to give the same
    user the materials<br/>specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br/>than the cost
    of performing this distribution.</p>
<p>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br/>from a designated place,
    offer equivalent access to copy the above<br/>specified materials from the same place.</p>
<p>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br/>materials or that you have
    already sent this user a copy.</p>
<p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br/>Library" must include any
    data and utility programs needed for<br/>reproducing the executable from it. However, as a
    special exception,<br/>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br/>normally
    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br/>components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on<br/>which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies<br/>the executable.</p>
<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br/>restrictions of other proprietary
    libraries that do not normally<br/>accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means
    you cannot<br/>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br/>distribute.
</p>
<p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br/>Library side-by-side in a
    single library together with other library<br/>facilities not covered by this License, and
    distribute such a combined<br/>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
    based on<br/>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br/>permitted, and
    provided that you do these two things:</p>
<p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br/>based on the Library,
    uncombined with any other library<br/>facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of
    the<br/>Sections above.</p>
<p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br/>that part of it is a work
    based on the Library, and explaining<br/>where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
    same work.</p>
<p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br/>the Library except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any<br/>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
    link with, or<br/>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br/>rights
    under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br/>or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses<br/>terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</p>
<p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>signed it. However,
    nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>distribute the Library or its derivative
    works. These actions are<br/>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
    by<br/>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), you
    indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>all its terms and conditions for
    copying, distributing or modifying<br/>the Library or works based on it.</p>
<p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), the recipient
    automatically receives a license from the<br/>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with
    or modify the Library<br/>subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
    further<br/>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>You are
    not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br/>this License.</p>
<p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>infringement or for any
    other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br/>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
    order, agreement or<br/>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
    not<br/>excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br/>distribute so as to
    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>License and any other pertinent
    obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>may not distribute the Library at all. For example,
    if a patent<br/>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br/>all
    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>the only way you could
    satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Library.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br/>particular
    circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br/>and the section as a whole is
    intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>patents or other property
    right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
    protecting the<br/>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br/>implemented
    by public license practices. Many people have made<br/>generous contributions to the wide range
    of software distributed<br/>through that system in reliance on consistent application of
    that<br/>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>to
    distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>be a consequence of the
    rest of this License.</p>
<p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br/>certain countries either
    by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>original copyright holder who places the
    Library under this License may add<br/>an explicit geographical distribution limitation
    excluding those countries,<br/>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not
    thus<br/>excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br/>written in
    the body of this License.</p>
<p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br/>versions of the Lesser
    General Public License from time to time.<br/>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
    present version,<br/>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br/>specifies a version
    number of this License which applies to it and<br/>"any later version", you have the option of
    following the terms and<br/>conditions either of that version or of any later version published
    by<br/>the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br/>license version
    number, you may choose any version ever published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br/>programs whose
    distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br/>write to the author to ask for
    permission. For software which is<br/>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
    Free<br/>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br/>decision will be
    guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br/>of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing<br/>and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
<p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br/>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO
    THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br/>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
    COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br/>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
    ANY<br/>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br/>IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
    THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br/>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,
    YOU ASSUME<br/>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br/>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
    HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br/>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED
    ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br/>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br/>CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br/>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
    LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br/>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
    OR A<br/>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br/>SUCH HOLDER OR
    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br/>DAMAGES.</p>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>
<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>possible use to the
    public, we recommend making it free software that<br/>everyone can redistribute and change. You
    can do so by permitting<br/>redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
    of the<br/>ordinary General Public License).</p>
<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br/>safest to attach
    them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br/>convey the exclusion of warranty;
    and each file should have at least the<br/>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
    notice is found.</p>
<p>&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>Copyright (C)
    &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br/>modify it under the terms of
    the GNU Lesser General Public<br/>License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
    either<br/>version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
    without even the implied warranty of<br/>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    See the GNU<br/>Lesser General Public License for more details.</p>
<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br/>License along with this
    library; if not, write to the Free Software<br/>Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth
    Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301<br/>USA</p>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br/>school, if any, to
    sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if<br/>necessary. Here is a sample; alter the
    names:</p>
<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br/>library `Frob' (a library for
    tweaking knobs) written by James Random<br/>Hacker.</p>

<p>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>
<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br/>Everyone is
    permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>of this license document, but changing it
    is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br/>software and other kinds of
    works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br/>to take away your
    freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,<br/>the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to<br/>share and change all versions of a program--to make
    sure it remains free<br/>software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
    the<br/>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br/>any other
    work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to<br/>your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>price. Our General Public
    Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br/>have the freedom to distribute copies of free
    software (and charge for<br/>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
    you<br/>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br/>free programs,
    and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br/>these rights or asking you
    to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have<br/>certain responsibilities if you distribute
    copies of the software, or if<br/>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of
    others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>gratis or for a fee, you
    must pass on to the recipients the same<br/>freedoms that you received. You must make sure that
    they, too, receive<br/>or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
    they<br/>know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br/>(1) assert copyright on
    the software, and (2) offer you this License<br/>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute
    and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br/>that there is no
    warranty for this free software. For both users' and<br/>authors' sake, the GPL requires that
    modified versions be marked as<br/>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed
    erroneously to<br/>authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br/>modified versions of the
    software inside them, although the manufacturer<br/>can do so. This is fundamentally
    incompatible with the aim of<br/>protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
    systematic<br/>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br/>use,
    which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we<br/>have designed this version
    of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br/>products. If such problems arise substantially
    in other domains, we<br/>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
    versions<br/>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br/>States should not allow
    patents to restrict development and use of<br/>software on general-purpose computers, but in
    those that do, we wish to<br/>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
    could<br/>make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br/>patents
    cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>modification follow.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>0. Definitions.</p>
<p>"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br/>works, such as
    semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br/>License. Each licensee is
    addressed as "you". "Licensees" and<br/>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br/>in a fashion requiring
    copyright permission, other than the making of an<br/>exact copy. The resulting work is called a
    "modified version" of the<br/>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</p>
<p>A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br/>on the Program.</p>
<p>To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br/>permission, would make you
    directly or secondarily liable for<br/>infringement under applicable copyright law, except
    executing it on a<br/>computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,<br/>distribution
    (with or without modification), making available to the<br/>public, and in some countries other
    activities as well.</p>
<p>To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br/>parties to make or
    receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through<br/>a computer network, with no transfer of
    a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br/>to the extent that it
    includes a convenient and prominently visible<br/>feature that (1) displays an appropriate
    copyright notice, and (2)<br/>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
    the<br/>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br/>work under this
    License, and how to view a copy of this License. If<br/>the interface presents a list of user
    commands or options, such as a<br/>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<p>1. Source Code.</p>
<p>The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br/>for making modifications to
    it. "Object code" means any non-source<br/>form of a work.</p>
<p>A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br/>standard defined by a
    recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br/>interfaces specified for a particular
    programming language, one that<br/>is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br/>than the work as a
    whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br/>packaging a Major Component, but which is
    not part of that Major<br/>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
    that<br/>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br/>implementation
    is available to the public in source code form. A<br/>"Major Component", in this context, means
    a major essential component<br/>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating
    system<br/>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br/>produce the
    work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br/>the source code needed to
    generate, install, and (for an executable<br/>work) run the object code and to modify the work,
    including scripts to<br/>control those activities. However, it does not include the work's<br/>System
    Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br/>programs which are used
    unmodified in performing those activities but<br/>which are not part of the work. For example,
    Corresponding Source<br/>includes interface definition files associated with source files
    for<br/>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br/>linked
    subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br/>such as by intimate data
    communication or control flow between those<br/>subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br/>can regenerate automatically
    from other parts of the Corresponding<br/>Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br/>same work.</p>
<p>2. Basic Permissions.</p>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br/>copyright on the Program,
    and are irrevocable provided the stated<br/>conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms
    your unlimited<br/>permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a<br/>covered
    work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br/>content, constitutes a covered
    work. This License acknowledges your<br/>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
    copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br/>convey, without conditions so
    long as your license otherwise remains<br/>in force. You may convey covered works to others for
    the sole purpose<br/>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br/>with
    facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br/>the terms of this License
    in conveying all material for which you do<br/>not control copyright. Those thus making or
    running the covered works<br/>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
    direction<br/>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br/>your
    copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br/>the conditions stated
    below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br/>makes it unnecessary.</p>
<p>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br/>measure under any
    applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br/>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted
    on 20 December 1996, or<br/>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br/>measures.
</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br/>circumvention of
    technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br/>is effected by exercising rights
    under this License with respect to<br/>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
    operation or<br/>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br/>users,
    your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br/>technological measures.</p>
<p>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br/>receive it, in any medium,
    provided that you conspicuously and<br/>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice;<br/>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br/>non-permissive
    terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br/>keep intact all notices of the
    absence of any warranty; and give all<br/>recipients a copy of this License along with the
    Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br/>and you may offer support
    or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<p>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br/>produce it from the
    Program, in the form of source code under the<br/>terms of section 4, provided that you also
    meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br/>it, and giving a relevant
    date.</p>
<p>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br/>released under this License and
    any conditions added under section<br/>7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4
    to<br/>"keep intact all notices".</p>
<p>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br/>License to anyone who comes into
    possession of a copy. This<br/>License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br/>additional
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br/>regardless of how they are packaged.
    This License gives no<br/>permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br/>invalidate
    such permission if you have separately received it.</p>
<p>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br/>Appropriate Legal Notices;
    however, if the Program has interactive<br/>interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
    Notices, your<br/>work need not make them do so.</p>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br/>works, which are not by
    their nature extensions of the covered work,<br/>and which are not combined with it such as to
    form a larger program,<br/>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called
    an<br/>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br/>used to limit the
    access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br/>beyond what the individual works permit.
    Inclusion of a covered work<br/>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
    other<br/>parts of the aggregate.</p>
<p>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br/>of sections 4 and 5,
    provided that you also convey the<br/>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of
    this License,<br/>in one of these ways:</p>
<p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>(including a physical
    distribution medium), accompanied by the<br/>Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical
    medium<br/>customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>(including a physical
    distribution medium), accompanied by a<br/>written offer, valid for at least three years and
    valid for as<br/>long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br/>model,
    to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br/>copy of the Corresponding Source
    for all the software in the<br/>product that is covered by this License, on a durable
    physical<br/>medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br/>more than your
    reasonable cost of physically performing this<br/>conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br/>Corresponding
    Source from a network server at no charge.</p>
<p>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br/>written offer to provide
    the Corresponding Source. This<br/>alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
    and<br/>only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br/>with subsection
    6b.</p>
<p>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br/>place (gratis or for a
    charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br/>Corresponding Source in the same way through the
    same place at no<br/>further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the<br/>Corresponding
    Source along with the object code. If the place to<br/>copy the object code is a network server,
    the Corresponding Source<br/>may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
    party)<br/>that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br/>clear
    directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br/>Corresponding Source. Regardless
    of what server hosts the<br/>Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
    is<br/>available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br/>you inform other peers
    where the object code and Corresponding<br/>Source of the work are being offered to the general
    public at no<br/>charge under subsection 6d.</p>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br/>from the Corresponding
    Source as a System Library, need not be<br/>included in conveying the object code work.</p>
<p>A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br/>tangible personal
    property which is normally used for personal, family,<br/>or household purposes, or (2) anything
    designed or sold for incorporation<br/>into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
    consumer product,<br/>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a
    particular<br/>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br/>typical or
    common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br/>of the particular user or of
    the way in which the particular user<br/>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
    product. A product<br/>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
    substantial<br/>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br/>the
    only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br/>procedures, authorization
    keys, or other information required to install<br/>and execute modified versions of a covered
    work in that User Product from<br/>a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The
    information must<br/>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
    object<br/>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br/>modification has
    been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br/>specifically for use in,
    a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br/>part of a transaction in which the right of
    possession and use of the<br/>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for
    a<br/>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br/>Corresponding
    Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br/>by the Installation Information. But
    this requirement does not apply<br/>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to
    install<br/>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br/>been
    installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br/>requirement to
    continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br/>for a work that has been modified
    or installed by the recipient, or for<br/>the User Product in which it has been modified or
    installed. Access to a<br/>network may be denied when the modification itself materially
    and<br/>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br/>protocols
    for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br/>in accord with this
    section must be in a format that is publicly<br/>documented (and with an implementation
    available to the public in<br/>source code form), and must require no special password or key
    for<br/>unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<p>7. Additional Terms.</p>
<p>"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br/>License by making
    exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br/>Additional permissions that are applicable to
    the entire Program shall<br/>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the
    extent<br/>that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions<br/>apply only to
    part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br/>under those permissions, but the
    entire Program remains governed by<br/>this License without regard to the additional
    permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br/>remove any additional
    permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br/>it. (Additional permissions may be written
    to require their own<br/>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place<br/>additional
    permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br/>for which you have or can give
    appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br/>add to a covered work,
    you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br/>that material) supplement the terms of
    this License with terms:</p>
<p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br/>terms of sections 15 and
    16 of this License; or</p>
<p>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br/>author attributions in
    that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br/>Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p>
<p>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br/>requiring that modified
    versions of such material be marked in<br/>reasonable ways as different from the original
    version; or</p>
<p>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br/>authors of the material;
    or</p>
<p>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br/>trade names, trademarks, or
    service marks; or</p>
<p>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br/>material by anyone who conveys
    the material (or modified versions of<br/>it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the
    recipient, for<br/>any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br/>those
    licensors and authors.</p>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br/>restrictions" within the
    meaning of section 10. If the Program as you<br/>received it, or any part of it, contains a
    notice stating that it is<br/>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br/>restriction,
    you may remove that term. If a license document contains<br/>a further restriction but permits
    relicensing or conveying under this<br/>License, you may add to a covered work material governed
    by the terms<br/>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br/>not
    survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br/>must place, in the
    relevant source files, a statement of the<br/>additional terms that apply to those files, or a
    notice indicating<br/>where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br/>form of a separately
    written license, or stated as exceptions;<br/>the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<p>8. Termination.</p>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br/>provided under this
    License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br/>modify it is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under<br/>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
    third<br/>paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br/>license from a particular
    copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br/>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder
    explicitly and<br/>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br/>holder
    fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br/>prior to 60 days after the
    cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br/>reinstated permanently if the
    copyright holder notifies you of the<br/>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
    time you have<br/>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br/>copyright
    holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br/>your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br/>licenses of parties who
    have received copies or rights from you under<br/>this License. If your rights have been
    terminated and not permanently<br/>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for
    the same<br/>material under section 10.</p>
<p>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br/>run a copy of the Program.
    Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br/>occurring solely as a consequence of using
    peer-to-peer transmission<br/>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
    However,<br/>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br/>modify
    any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do<br/>not accept this License.
    Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br/>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
    License to do so.</p>
<p>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br/>receives a license from the
    original licensors, to run, modify and<br/>propagate that work, subject to this License. You are
    not responsible<br/>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p>An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br/>organization, or
    substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br/>organization, or merging organizations.
    If propagation of a covered<br/>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br/>transaction
    who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br/>licenses to the work the party's
    predecessor in interest had or could<br/>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
    possession of the<br/>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br/>the
    predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br/>rights granted or affirmed
    under this License. For example, you may<br/>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge
    for exercise of<br/>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br/>(including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br/>any patent claim is infringed by
    making, using, selling, offering for<br/>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
</p>
<p>11. Patents.</p>
<p>A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br/>License of the Program or
    a work on which the Program is based. The<br/>work thus licensed is called the contributor's
    "contributor version".</p>
<p>A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br/>owned or controlled by the
    contributor, whether already acquired or<br/>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
    manner, permitted<br/>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor
    version,<br/>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br/>consequence of
    further modification of the contributor version. For<br/>purposes of this definition, "control"
    includes the right to grant<br/>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements
    of<br/>this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br/>patent license under the
    contributor's essential patent claims, to<br/>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
    otherwise run, modify and<br/>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br/>agreement or commitment,
    however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br/>(such as an express permission to practice a
    patent or covenant not to<br/>sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to
    a<br/>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br/>patent against
    the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br/>and the Corresponding
    Source of the work is not available for anyone<br/>to copy, free of charge and under the terms
    of this License, through a<br/>publicly available network server or other readily accessible
    means,<br/>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br/>available, or
    (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br/>patent license for this particular
    work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br/>consistent with the requirements of this License, to
    extend the patent<br/>license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have<br/>actual
    knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br/>covered work in a country, or
    your recipient's use of the covered work<br/>in a country, would infringe one or more
    identifiable patents in that<br/>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br/>arrangement, you convey, or
    propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br/>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of
    the parties<br/>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br/>or
    convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br/>you grant is
    automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br/>work and works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br/>the scope of its coverage,
    prohibits the exercise of, or is<br/>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the
    rights that are<br/>specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered<br/>work
    if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br/>in the business of
    distributing software, under which you make payment<br/>to the third party based on the extent
    of your activity of conveying<br/>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
    the<br/>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br/>patent license
    (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br/>conveyed by you (or copies made from those
    copies), or (b) primarily<br/>for and in connection with specific products or compilations
    that<br/>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br/>or that patent
    license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br/>any implied license or
    other defenses to infringement that may<br/>otherwise be available to you under applicable
    patent law.</p>
<p>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>otherwise) that
    contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>excuse you from the conditions of
    this License. If you cannot convey a<br/>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
    obligations under this<br/>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
    you may<br/>not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br/>to
    collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br/>the Program, the only
    way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br/>License would be to refrain entirely from
    conveying the Program.</p>
<p>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br/>permission to link or combine
    any covered work with a work licensed<br/>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
    License into a single<br/>combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
    this<br/>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br/>but the
    special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br/>section 13, concerning
    interaction through a network will apply to the<br/>combination as such.</p>
<p>14. Revised Versions of this License.</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br/>the GNU General
    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br/>be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to<br/>address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br/>Program specifies that a
    certain numbered version of the GNU General<br/>Public License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the<br/>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br/>version
    or of any later version published by the Free Software<br/>Foundation. If the Program does not
    specify a version number of the<br/>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever
    published<br/>by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br/>versions of the GNU General
    Public License can be used, that proxy's<br/>public statement of acceptance of a version
    permanently authorizes you<br/>to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different<br/>permissions. However, no
    additional obligations are imposed on any<br/>author or copyright holder as a result of your
    choosing to follow a<br/>later version.</p>
<p>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br/>APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br/>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
    "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br/>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO,<br/>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>PURPOSE.
    THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br/>IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br/>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
    CORRECTION.</p>
<p>16. Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
    HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br/>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
    LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br/>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br/>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
    LOSS OF<br/>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br/>PARTIES
    OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br/>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
    OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br/>SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</p>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br/>above cannot be given
    local legal effect according to their terms,<br/>reviewing courts shall apply local law that
    most closely approximates<br/>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with
    the<br/>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br/>copy of the
    Program in return for a fee.</p>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>possible use to the
    public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br/>free software which everyone can
    redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br/>to attach them to the
    start of each source file to most effectively<br/>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file
    should have at least<br/>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
