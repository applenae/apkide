	<p>
		Version 2.1, February 1999
	</p>

	<pre>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
</pre>


	<h4 id="SEC2">Preamble</h4>

	<p>
		The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
		freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
		Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
		free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
	</p>
	<p>
		This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
		specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
		Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
		can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
		this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
		strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
	</p>
	<p>
		When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
		not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
		you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
		for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
		it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
		it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
		these things.
	</p>
	<p>
		To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
		distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
		rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
		you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
		or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
		you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
		code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
		complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
		with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
		it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
	</p>
	<p>
		We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
		library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
		permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
	</p>
	<p>
		To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
		there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
		modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
		that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
		author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
		introduced by others.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
		any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
		effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
		restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
		any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
		consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
		ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
		General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
		is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
		this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
		libraries into non-free programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
		a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
		combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
		General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
		entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
		Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
		the library.
	</p>
	<p>
		We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
		does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
		Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less
		of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages
		are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
		libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
		special circumstances.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
		encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
		a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
		allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
		library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
		case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
		software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
	</p>
	<p>
		In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
		programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
		free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
		non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
		operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
		system.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
		users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
		linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
		that program using a modified version of the Library.
	</p>
	<p>
		The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
		modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
		"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
		former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
		be combined with the library in order to run.
	</p>

	<h4 id="SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h4>


	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">0.</strong>
			This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
			program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
			other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
			this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
			Each licensee is addressed as "you".
		</font></p>
	<p>
		A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
		prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
		(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
	</p>
	<p>
		The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
		which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
		Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
		copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
		portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
		straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
		included without limitation in the term "modification".)
	</p>
	<p>
		"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
		making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
		all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
		interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
		and installation of the library.
	</p>
	<p>
		Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
		covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
		running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
		such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
		on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
		writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
		and what the program that uses the Library does.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">1.</strong>
			You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
			complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
			you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
			appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
			all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
			warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
			Library.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
		and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
		fee.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">2.</strong>
			You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
			of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
			distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
			above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
		</font></p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>a)</strong>
			The modified work must itself be a software library.
		</li>
		<li><strong>b)</strong>
			You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
			stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
		</li>

		<li><strong>c)</strong>
			You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
			charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
		</li>

		<li><font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">d)</strong>
			If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
			table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
			the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
			is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
			in the event an application does not supply such function or
			table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
			its purpose remains meaningful.
		</font>
			<p>
				(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
				a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
				application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
				application-supplied function or table used by this function must
				be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
				root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
		sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
		reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
		this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
		distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
		sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
		distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
		permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
		each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
		rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
		the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
		based on the Library.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
		the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
		or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
		this License.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">3.</strong>
			You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
			License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
			this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
			that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
			instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
			ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
			that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
			these notices.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
		that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
		subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
	</p>
	<p>
		This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
		the Library into a program that is not a library.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">4.</strong>
			You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
			derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
			under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
			it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
			must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
			medium customarily used for software interchange.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
		from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
		source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
		distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
		compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">5.</strong>
			A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
			Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
			linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
			work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
			therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
		creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
		contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
		library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
		Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
		that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
		derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
		Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
		linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
		threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
	</p>
	<p>
		If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
		structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
		functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
		file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
		work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
		Library will still fall under Section 6.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
		distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
		Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
		whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">6.</strong>
			As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
			link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
			work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
			under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
			modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
			engineering for debugging such modifications.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
		Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
		this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
		during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
		copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
		directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
		of these things:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
			corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
			including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
			distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
			executable linked with the Library, with the complete
			machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
			and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
			then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
			modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the
			contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
			be able to recompile the application to use the modified
			definitions.)
		</li>

		<li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
			for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
			(1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
			user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
			the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
			version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
			modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
			work was made with.
		</li>

		<li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
			valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
			materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
			than the cost of performing this distribution.
		</li>

		<li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
			offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
			access to copy the above specified materials from the same
			place.
		</li>

		<li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
			a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
			a copy.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
		Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
		reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
		the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
		normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
		components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
		which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
		the executable.
	</p>
	<p>
		It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
		restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
		accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
		use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
		distribute.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">7.</strong> You may place library facilities
			that are a work
			based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
			other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
			such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
			the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
			otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
		</font></p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
			of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
			library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of
			the Sections above.
		</li>

		<li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
			library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
			Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
			form of the same work.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">8.</strong> You may not copy, modify,
			sublicense, link with,
			or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
			License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
			with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
			terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
			received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
			their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
			compliance.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">9.</strong>
			You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
			signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
			distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
			prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
			modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
			Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
			all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
			the Library or works based on it.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">10.</strong>
			Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
			Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
			original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
			subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
			restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
			You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
			this License.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">11.</strong>
			If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
			infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
			conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
			otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
			excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
			distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
			License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
			may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
			license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
			all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
			the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
			refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
		particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
		and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
		patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
		such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
		integrity of the free software distribution system which is
		implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
		generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
		through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
		system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
		to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
		impose that choice.
	</p>
	<p>
		This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
		be a consequence of the rest of this License.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">12.</strong>
			If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
			certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
			original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
			an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
			so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
			excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
			written in the body of this License.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">13.</strong>
			The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
			versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
			Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
			but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
		specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
		"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
		conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
		the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
		license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
		the Free Software Foundation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">14.</strong>
			If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
			programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
			write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
			copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
			Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
			decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
			of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
			and reuse of software generally.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		<strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">15.</strong>
			BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
			WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
			EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
			OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
			KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
			IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
			PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
			LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
			THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
		</font></p>
	<p>
		<font _mstmutation="1"><strong _mstmutation="1">16.</strong>
			IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
			WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
			AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
			FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
			CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
			LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
			RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
			FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
			SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
			DAMAGES.

	permissions granted by this License.</p>

<p> &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but
	not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.</p>

<p> &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
	translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated
	documentation, and conversions to other media types.</p>

<p> &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
	available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached
	to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>

<p> &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
	based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
	elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For
	the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
	from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works
	thereof.</p>

<p> &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of
	the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
	intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
	individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
	purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or
	written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking
	systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
	improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
	designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom
	a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>

<p> 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
	Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
	irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
	publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
	Object form.</p>

<p> 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
	Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
	irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
	sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
	patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
	Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
	a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution
	incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
	patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
	such litigation is filed.</p>

<p> 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
	thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
	that You meet the following conditions:</p>

<p> (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License;
	and</p>

<p> (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
	files; and</p>

<p> (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
	copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>

<p> (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any
	Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
	contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
	distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
	provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
	Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file
	are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own
	attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
	the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
	construed as modifying the License.</p>

<p> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
	different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
	modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
	distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>

<p> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
	intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
	terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
	license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>

<p> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
	service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary
	use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

<p> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
	provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot;
	BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
	without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
	FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
	of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
	permissions under this License.</p>

<p> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
	negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
	grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
	damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
	character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
	(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
	malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
	been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
	thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
	indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
	in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
	responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
	against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
	liability.</p>

<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p> APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</p>

<p> To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the
	fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot; replaced with your own identifying information.
	(Don't include the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for

<p>Copyright (c) 2019 - Present, Microsoft Corporation,<br>
	with Reserved Font Name Cascadia Code.</p>

<p>This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.<br>
	This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:<br>
	http://scripts.sil.org/OFL</p>

<p>
	-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
	SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
	-----------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>PREAMBLE<br>
	The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
	development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
	efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
	open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
	with others.</p>

<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
	redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
	fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br>
	redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>
	names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
	however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
	requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
	to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS<br>
	&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br>
	Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br>
	include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>

<p>&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to any names specified as such after the<br>
	copyright statement(s).</p>

<p>&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br>
	distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>

<p>&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br>
	or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the<br>
	Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br>
	new environment.</p>

<p>&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br>
	writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>

<p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS<br>
	Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br>
	a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br>
	redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br>
	Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br>
	in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>

<p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br>
	redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br>
	contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br>
	included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br>
	in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br>
	binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>

<p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br>
	Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br>
	Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br>
	presented to the users.</p>

<p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br>
	Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br>
	Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br>
	Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br>
	permission.</p>

<p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br>
	must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br>
	distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br>
	remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br>
	using the Font Software.</p>

<p>TERMINATION<br>
	This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br>
	not met.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER<br>
	THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br>
	EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF<br>
	MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT<br>
	OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE<br>
	COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,<br>
	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL<br>
	DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING<br>
	FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM<br>
	OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.</p>

	-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
	SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
	-----------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>PREAMBLE<br>
	The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br>
	development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br>
	efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br>
	open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br>
	with others.</p>

<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br>
	redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br>
	fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, <br>
	redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br>
	names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br>
	however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br>
	requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br>
	to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS<br>

	Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br>

	copyright statement(s).</p>

<p>&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br>

<p>&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br>

<p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br>

	permission.</p>

<p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br>
	must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br>
	distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br>
	remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br>
	using the Font Software.</p>

<p>TERMINATION<br>

	not met.</p>
